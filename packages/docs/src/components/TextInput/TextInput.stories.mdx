### autoComplete

Indicates whether the value of the control can be automatically completed by the
browser. [Accepted values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).

### autoCorrect

Automatically correct spelling mistakes. (Only available in iOS Safari.)

### autoFocus

If `true`, focuses the input on `componentDidMount`. Only the first form element
in a document with `autofocus` is focused.

### blurOnSubmit

If `true`, the text field will blur when submitted. The default value is `true`
for single-line fields and `false` for multiline fields. Note, for `multiline`
fields setting `blurOnSubmit` to `true` means that pressing return will blur the
field and trigger the `onSubmitEditing` event instead of inserting a newline
into the field.

### clearTextOnFocus

If `true`, clears the text field automatically when focused.

  </Story>
</Preview>

### defaultValue

Provides an initial value that will change when the user starts typing. Useful
for simple use-cases where you don't want to deal with listening to events and
updating the value prop to keep the controlled state in sync.

### disabled

If `true`, the input is disabled. (Web-only)

### editable

If `false`, text is not editable (i.e., read-only).

  <Story name="editable">
    <Stories.editable />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### keyboardType

Possible values: `"default" | "email-address" | "numeric" | "phone-pad" | "search" | "url" | "web-search"`.

Determines which keyboard to open on devices with a virtual keyboard. Safari iOS
requires an ancestral `<form action>` element to display the `search` keyboard).
(Not available when `multiline` is `true`.)

    <Stories.multiline />
  </Story>

### numberOfLines

Sets the number of lines for a multiline `TextInput`. (Requires `multiline` to be `true`.)

### onChange

Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.

### onChangeText

Callback that is called when the text input's text changes. The text is passed as an argument to the callback handler.

### onContentSizeChange

Callback that is called when the text input's content size changes. This will be
called with `{ nativeEvent: { contentSize: { width, height } } }`. Only called
for multiline text inputs.

### onKeyPress

Callback that is called when a key is pressed. This will be called with `{
nativeEvent: { key: keyValue } }` where `keyValue` is `Enter`, `Backspace`,
`Tab`, `Arrow{Up,Right,Down,Left}` for respective keys and the typed-in
character otherwise including `' '` for space. Modifier keys (e.g., `shiftKey`)
are also included in the `nativeEvent`. Fires before `onChange` callbacks.

### onSelectionChange

Callback that is called when the text input's selection changes. This will be
called with `{ nativeEvent: { selection: { start, end } } }`.

    <Stories.onSelectionChange />

</Preview>

### onSubmitEditing

Callback that is called when the keyboard's submit button is pressed. When
`multiline={true}`, this is only called if `blurOnSubmit={true}`.

### placeholder

The string that will be rendered in an empty `TextInput` before text has been entered.

  <Story name="placeholder">
    <Stories.placeholder />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### placeholderTextColor

The text color of the placeholder string.

    <Stories.placeholderTextColor />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### returnKeyType

Possible values: `'enter' | 'done' | 'go' | 'next' | 'previous' | 'search' | 'send'`.

Specifies what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual
keyboards. Maps to the `enterkeyhint` attribute on web.

### secureTextEntry

If `true`, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like
passwords stay secure. (Not available when `multiline` is `true`.)

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="secureTextEntry">
    <Stories.secureTextEntry />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### selection

The start and end of the text input's selection. Set start and end to the same
value to position the cursor.

### selectTextOnFocus

If `true`, all text will automatically be selected on focus.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="selectTextOnFocus">
    <Stories.selectTextOnFocus />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### spellCheck

If `false`, disables spell-check style (i.e. red underlines). The default value
is inherited from `autoCorrect`. (Only available in supporting browsers).

### style

```js
{
  ...TextProps.style
  resize: string, // web-only
}
```

### value

The value to show for the text input. TextInput is a controlled component, which means the native value will be forced to match this prop if provided. Read about how [React form components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) work. To prevent user edits to the value set `editable={false}`.

## Instance methods

### blur()

Blur the underlying DOM input.

### clear()

Clear the text from the underlying DOM input.

### focus()

Focus the underlying DOM input.

### isFocused()
