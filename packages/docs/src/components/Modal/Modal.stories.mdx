# Modal

The Modal component is a basic way to present content above an enclosing view.
Modals may be nested within other Modals.

## Props

| Name                      | Type           | Default |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| animationType             | ?AnimationType | 'none' |
| children                  | ?any           | |
| onDismiss                 | ?Function      | |
| onRequestClose            | ?Function      | |
| onShow                    | ?Function      | |
| transparent               | ?boolean       | false |
| visible                   | ?boolean       | true |

### animationType

The `animationType` prop can be used to add animation to the modal
being opened or dismissed.

* `none` - the modal appears without any animation.
* `slide` - the modal slides up from the bottom of the screen.
* `fade` - the modal fades in.

By default this is `none`.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="propsExample-animationType">
    <Stories.animatedModal />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### onDismiss

The `onDismiss` callback is called after the modal has been dismissed and is no longer visible.

### onRequestClose

The `onRequestClose` callback is called when the user is attempting to close the modal -
such as when they hit `Escape`.

Only the top-most Modal responds to hitting `Escape`.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="propsExample-onRequestClose">
    <Stories.modalception />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### onShow

The `onShow` callback is called once the modal has been shown and may be visible.

### transparent

The `transparent` prop determines if the modal is rendered with a `transparent` backdrop or
a `white` backdrop.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="propsExample-transparent">
    <Stories.transparentModal />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### visible

Whether or not the modal is visible.

When set to `false` the contents are not rendered & the modal removes itself
from the screen.

<Preview withSource='none'>
  <Story name="propsExample-visible">
    <Stories.simpleModal />
  </Story>
</Preview>
