# Accessibility

On the Web, assistive technologies (e.g., VoiceOver, TalkBack screen readers)
derive useful information about the structure, purpose, and interactivity of
apps from their [HTML elements][html-accessibility-url], attributes, and [ARIA
in HTML][aria-in-html-url]. React Native for Web includes APIs designed to
provide developers with support for making apps more accessible. The most
common and best supported accessibility features of the Web are exposed as the
props: `accessible`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityLiveRegion`,
`accessibilityRole`, and `importantForAccessibility`.

## Accessibility properties

### accessibilityLabel

Overrides the text that's read by a screen reader when a person interacts with
the element. (This is implemented using `aria-label`.)

```js
<View accessibilityLabel="Timeline: trending topics">
  <View>...</View>
</View>
```

### accessibilityLiveRegion: 'assertive' | 'none' | 'polite'

Allows assistive technologies to announce dynamic changes to a view. The values
of this attribute are expressed in degrees of importance. When regions are
specified as `polite` (recommended), updates take low priority. When regions are
specified as `assertive`, assistive technologies will interrupt and immediately
announce the change. (This is implemented using `aria-live`.)

* `none`: Accessibility services should not announce changes to this view.
* `polite`: Accessibility services should announce changes to this view.
* `assertive`: Accessibility services should interrupt ongoing speech to immediately announce changes to this view.

```js
<Text accessibilityLiveRegion="polite">
  Clicked {count} times
</Text>
```

### accessibilityRelationship: ?object

...

### accessibilityRole: ?string

Indicates to assistive technologies how to describe the view, e.g., that it is a "button".

Allows assistive technologies to present and support interaction with the view
in a manner that is consistent with user expectations for similar views of that
type. For example, marking a touchable view with an accessibilityRole of button.
(This is implemented using ARIA roles.)

The `accessibilityRole` prop is used to infer an [analogous HTML
element][html-aria-url] and ARIA `role`, where possible. In most cases, both
the element and ARIA `role` are rendered. While this may contradict some ARIA
recommendations, it also helps avoid certain browser bugs, HTML5 conformance
errors, and accessibility anti-patterns (e.g., giving a `heading` role to a
`button` element).

Straight-forward examples:

* `<View accessibilityRole="article" />` => `<article role="article" />`.
* `<View accessibilityRole="banner" />` => `<header role="banner" />`.
* `<Text accessibilityRole="label" />` => `<label />`.
* `<Text accessibilityRole="link" />` => `<a role="link" />`.
* `<View accessibilityRole="main" />` => `<main role="main" />`.

The `heading` role can be combined with `aria-level`:

* `<Text accessibilityRole="heading" />` => `<h1 />`.
* `<Text accessibilityRole="heading" aria-level="3" />` => `<h3 />`.

The `button` role renders an accessible button but is not implemented using the
native `button` element due to some browsers limiting the use of flexbox layout
on its children.

* `<View accessibilityRole="button" />` => `<div role="button" tabIndex="0" />`.

Note: Avoid changing `accessibilityRole` values over time or after user
actions. Generally, accessibility APIs do not provide a means of notifying
assistive technologies of a `role` value change.

### accessibilityState: ?object

### accessibilityValue: ?object

### accessible

When `true`, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. When a view
is an accessibility element, it groups its children into a single focusable
component. By default, all touchable elements, buttons, and links are
"accessible". Prefer using `accessibilityRole` (e.g., `button`, `link`) to
create focusable HTML elements wherever possible. On web, `accessible={true}`
is implemented using `tabIndex`.

When `true`, indicates that the view is an accessibility element (i.e.,
focusable) and groups its child content. By default, all the touchable elements
and elements with `accessibilityRole` of `button` and `link` are accessible.
(This is implemented using `tabindex`.)

### importantForAccessibility

The `importantForAccessibility` property controls if a view appears in the
accessibility tree and if it is reported to accessibility services. On web, a
value of `no` will remove a focusable element from the tab flow, and a value of
`no-hide-descendants` will also hide the entire subtree from assistive
technologies. (This is implemented using `aria-hidden`).

### nativeID

Used to locate this view from any native DOM code, or to define accessibility
relationships. This is rendered to the native `id` DOM attribute.

## Additional topics

### Spatial navigation

Focus-based web UIs, e.g., for TVs and Game Consoles can implement [TV remote
control navigation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS_for_TV/TV_remote_control_navigation)
outside of React using existing directional-focus libraries. Every DOM element
that React Native considers focusable can be matched by the attribute
`data-focusable="true"`.

```js
const focusableElements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-focusable="true"]');
```

### Other ARIA properties

Other ARIA properties can be set via [direct
manipulation](./direct-manipulation.md) or props (this may change in the
future).
